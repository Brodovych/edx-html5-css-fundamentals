        Short quotation. <q>To err is human</q> - Alexander Pope
        <p>
            Albert Einstein once said <hr><blockquote>The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery every day. Never lose a holy curiosity. </blockquote><hr>
            <pre>
                    Higher still and higher
                    From the earth thou springest
                  Like a cloud of fire;
                    The blue deep thou wingest,
           And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.
